# CSDS Pre-processor

A web application that transforms CSV files from various social media platforms into the format required by the [Coordinated Sharing Detection Service](https://coortweet.lab.atc.gr/) powered by [CooRTweet](https://github.com/nicolarighetti/CooRTweet).

This work was carried out in the context of the [VERA.AI project](https://veraai.eu).

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-platform Support**: Converts data from various platforms to CSDS format:
  - Meta Content Library (Facebook and Instagram)
  - TikTok Research API
  - YouTube (via YouTube Data Tools)
  - BlueSky (via Communalytic)
  - Telegram

- **Flexible Data Mapping**:
  - Customizable account source selection (e.g., post owner vs. surface for Meta platforms)
  - Multiple object ID source options for each platform (e.g., text content, links, descriptions)
  - Platform-specific field mappings with proper validation

- **Advanced File Size Management**:
  - Automatic file splitting for large datasets (>15MB)
  - Time-based splitting (weekly, monthly, quarterly) for temporal analysis
  - Stratified sampling that maintains account distribution with adjustable sample percentage

- **Data Processing Features**:
  - Client-side processing (privacy-focused - no data sent to any server)
  - Detailed processing feedback with counts of processed and skipped rows
  - Automatic timestamp conversion to UNIX format
  - CSV validation with error handling and feedback

- **Export Options**:
  - Direct CSV download for standard-sized files
  - ZIP archive download for split files
  - Descriptive naming conventions for output files

## 📊 Input Formats

### Meta Content Library (Facebook & Instagram)

Required fields:
- `surface.id`/`post_owner.id` (account identifier)
- `surface.name`/`post_owner.name` (account name)
- `id` (content identifier)
- `creation_time` (post timestamp)
- `text` (post text content)
- `link_attachment.link` (link URL if present, for Facebook)

### TikTok Research API

Required fields:
- `video_id` (content identifier)
- `author_name` (account identifier)
- `create_time` (post timestamp)
- Various content fields available as object_id source:
  - `video_description`
  - `voice_to_text`
  - `effect_ids`
  - `music_id`
  - `hashtag_names`

### YouTube (via YouTube Data Tools)

Required fields from [YouTube Data Tools Video List function](https://ytdt.digitalmethods.net/mod_videos_list.php):
- `videoId` (content identifier)
- `channelTitle` (channel name)
- `channelId` (account identifier)
- `publishedAt` (video timestamp)
- Content options (select one):
  - `videoTitle`
  - `videoDescription`
  - `tags`

### BlueSky (via Communalytic)

Required fields from [Communalytic](https://communalytic.org/) exports:
- `id` (content identifier)
- `username` (account identifier)
- `date` (post timestamp)
- `text` (post content)

### Telegram

Required fields:
- `channel_name` (channel name)
- `channel_id` (channel identifier)
- `message_id` (content identifier)
- `date` (message timestamp)
- `sender_id` (sender identifier)
- `post_author` (author name)
- `message_text` (message content)

Two account source options:
- Channel (uses `channel_name` and `channel_id`)
- Author (uses `post_author` and `sender_id`)

## 📋 Output Format (CSDS)

The tool generates a standardized CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `account_id` | Unique ID of an account (formatted as name + ID for most platforms) |
| `content_id` | Unique ID of the content (post, video, message, etc.) |
| `object_id` | Content identifier (text, link, description, etc. based on selected option) |
| `timestamp_share` | UNIX timestamp of the content creation |

## 📦 File Size Management

The CSDS service has a 15MB file size limit. For datasets that exceed this limit, the tool offers three options:

1. **Split Into Multiple Files**: 
   - Automatically divides data into multiple files under 15MB
   - Packages results in a ZIP archive
   - Split is based on row count to ensure files stay under the limit

2. **Split By Time Period**: 
   - Divides data into separate files by time periods:
     - Weekly (7-day periods)
     - Monthly (30-day periods)
     - Quarterly (90-day periods)
   - Results bundled into a ZIP archive with appropriate naming

3. **Sample Data**: 
   - Creates a representative sample while maintaining account distribution
   - Adjustable sample size percentage (10-90%)
   - Ensures all accounts are represented in the sample
   - Preserves the original distribution of content across accounts

## 📝 Usage

1. Visit [CSDS Pre-processor](https://fabiogiglietto.github.io/csds-preprocessor/)
2. Select the source platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, BlueSky, or Telegram)
3. Choose the account source field based on your platform
4. Select the object_id source field based on your platform and needs
5. Upload your CSV file
6. Review processing feedback and row counts
7. If the file exceeds 15MB, select a file size management option
8. Download the transformed CSV file(s) ready for the CSDS
